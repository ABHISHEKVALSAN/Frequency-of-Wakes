#Frequency-of-wakes

What are wakes?

Wake turbulence is a disturbance in the atmosphere that forms behind an aircraft as it passes through the air. It includes various components, the most important of which are wingtip vortices and jetwash. Jetwash refers simply to the rapidly moving gases expelled from a jet engine; it is extremely turbulent, but of short duration.

This project takes a video input and converts it into frames/images.

We crop a fluctuating region in this series of images and does image processing by using fast fourier transform to find the frequency at which fluctuation happens.

This project can be genralized to find any type of frequency in a video.
